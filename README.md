Stormy is a bot that can be used to brainstorm and collect ideas in a Discord server.
Ideas can be collected in a channel and can get up- or down-voted.

Furthermore, stormy supports 'actions' that allow ideas to be reposted to Trello boards, GitHub discussions, GitHub issues, or different Discord channels, either by reaction or automatically.
You can also mirror GitHub issues and discussions into a thread, so that users that don't have a GitHub account can directly participate in your idea finding.
